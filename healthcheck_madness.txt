- uwsgi is up but the python process is not up
    - runs the http request in a separate process

- return a non-502 response
- k8s shutting down the pod for valid reasons vs a healthcheck failure is not perceptible and creates the down file either
- FP: are we conflating the the signal to tell k8s to restart the pod with the signal to envoy to not send traffic to the pod
    - if we are draining the node
    - would it be logical to add a different healthcheck for envoy?
